##The basis for the development of supply-chain financing
The scale of underlying liquid assets is enough, but supply capacity limits industry size.
The main forms of supply chain financing products are based on accounts receivable and (future) inventories. In China, the accounts receivable and inventory scale of industrial enterprises have already had a certain volume, which laid the foundation for the corresponding supply chain financing. However, the scale of supply chain financing is far less than the basic accounts receivable and inventory financing scale.

**Difficult credit transfers and narrow service scope**
Since it is difficult for core enterprises to transfer credit to upstream and downstream enterprises, service targets are limited to large enterprises and first-tier suppliers. Otherwise, second-tier suppliers (mostly SME), which really need funds still face problems such as obstructs in financing, high financing costs and inflexible loan terms.
**High operating costs and low business efficiency**
Traditional financial institutions such as banks face a single downstream enterprise, and the cost of solving information symmetry and mastering corporate credit is high:
