**1.The current state of supply chain finance**
  ----------------------------------------------
**1.1 The main form of supply chain finance**  

Supply chain finance (SCF) comprises trade-financing, which includes three traditional forms of SCF: accounts receivable financing, inventory financing, prepayment financing, and emerging SCF forms – strategies relationship financing.

* **ARIF（accounts receivable and inventory financing）** is one kind of commercial loans based on asset-control. ARIF can accelerate the cycling speed of capital occupation from inventory, lowering the cost of capital occupation.   
* **Prepayment financing** refers to credit guarantee provided by the third-party logistics enterprise on the premise of the upstream enterprise's commitment to repurchase, and the SME apply for the pledge loan by the financial institutions alleviate the prepayment pressure. Meanwhile, financial institutions control the financing of their delivery rights.  
* **Strategic relationship financing** requires high levels of trust from both supply and demand side of funds. This feature differentiates original enterprise financing.  

**1.2 The basis for the development of Supply Chain Finance**  
The scale of underlying liquid assets is enough, but supply capacity limits industry size.  
The main forms of SCF products are based on accounts receivable and (future) inventories. In China, the scale of industrial enterprises’ accounts receivable and inventory have already reached a certain volume, which laid the foundation for the corresponding SCF. However, the scale of SCF is far less than the basic accounts receivable and inventory financing's scale.

However, the banker survey showed that the SME loan demand index continued to be greater than 50%, indicating that the demand for corporate financing continued to exist, while the bank loan approval index continued to be below 50%, revealing that bank loan approval conditions are constantly tightening. Overall, the factors affecting the scale of the supply-chain financing originates from supply side, instead of demand side.

**1.3 Industry scale of supply chain finance**  
According to the National Bureau of Statistics, it is estimated that the market size of China's supply chain finance will maintain steady growth. The report shows that from 2015 to 2022, the growth rate of the supply chain financial industry will stabilize at around 5%. By 2020, industry scale of supply chain finance in China will reach 2.4 trillion yuan.

**2. Pain points in supply chain finance**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
* **Difficult credit transfers and narrow service scope**
Since it is difficult for core enterprises to transfer credit to upstream and downstream enterprises, service targets are limited to large enterprises and first-tier suppliers. Otherwise, second-tier suppliers (mostly SME), which really need funds still face problems such as obstructs in financing, high financing costs and inflexible loan terms.  
* **High operating costs and low business efficiency**  
Traditional financial institutions such as banks face a single downstream enterprise, and the cost of solving information symmetry and mastering corporate credit is high:
The real trade background check, the past link is completed manually by manually checking various invoice contracts. Due to the manual operation, there are disadvantages of high error rate and high fraud risk while being inefficient.  

**3. Application of Block chain in supply chain finance**  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pain point of traditional supply chain finance is indeed the suitable solution scene applying blockchain. Blockchain is a fusion technology of point-to-point communication, digital encryption, distributed ledger, multi-party consensus algorithm, etc. It is non-tamperable and data-traceable, very suitable for multi-participating supply chain financial business scenarios. Through blockchain technology, data can be trusted, mutual recognition and circulation, core enterprise credits can be transmitted, performance risks can be prevented, operational efficiency can be improved, and business costs can be reduced.  

**The benefits and improvements of blockchain for supply chain finance business are as follows:**
  * Difficult to solve the problem of information transmission  
  * Transfer the credit of the core enterprise  
  * Enrich trustworthy trade scenes  
  * Apply smart contracts to prevent compliance risk  
  * Achieve financing cost efficiency  
  
 _Figure 5.Blockchain supply chain finance V.S. Traditional supply chain finance**_  

Type|Block-chain supply-chain finance |Traditional supplychain finance  
----|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------  
Information flow|smooth|Obstructive  
Credit transfer|Can arrive at multi-level supplier|Limited to first-level supplier  
Business Scene|Full-chain penetration|Core enterprise and 1st grade supplier  
Payment Control|controllable|uncontrollable  
SME Financing|Convenient and cheap in financing|Costly and difficult in financing  

In summary, blockchain can transfer credit of core enterprises to multi-level suppliers of the entire supply chain, improve the financing efficiency of the entire chain, enrich the business scenarios of financial institutions, and thus improve the operational efficiency of funds in the entire supply chain.  

**4. How blockchain strengthens supply chain finance**  
-----------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned above, the pain points of supply chain finance include how to ensure the authenticity of transactions, resolve high operating costs, and improve market coverage. The development of supply chain finance just catches up with the development of blockchain, and the combination has become one of the hotspots of blockchain’ application.  

The application of blockchain in supply chain finance is mainly based on the following aspects: transaction confirmation based on encrypted data, proof of authenticity based on deposit certificate, credit dismantling based on shared ledger, and contract execution based on smart contract. In the end, it can meet the mutual verification and matching of multiple sources of information in the supply chain, and solve the painful point of mistrust of funds to transaction data.  

**4.1 Transaction confirmation based on Encrypted data**  
Application of block chain put forwards higher demands on the information of supply-chain. Although core enterprises and tier one suppliers and distributors in many industries have a good level of information, but the degree of information of SMEs at other levels in the chain is difficult to meet the bank's data standards. At the same time, if different entities on the chain use different types of information management systems, information transmission lacks consistency and continuity, and it is easy to form information isolated islands. It is difficult to obtain effective data for risk judgement and management, to verify the authenticity of transactions. It can be seen that one of the premise of block-chain application is the information of the whole chain.  

The blockchain has begun to show important application value in the field of asset management, realizing the real-time nature of confirmation, authorization and transaction supervision of various assets. For intangible assets that are difficult to regulate and protect under the network environment, block-chain is a new method of intellectual property protection in virtual environments based on the characteristics of time stamp technology and immutable. For tangible assets, such as deposit certificates, accounts receivable and digital smart assets, real-world asset transactions can be realized in a virtual environment, such as asset authorization and usage control, product traceability and other applications.  

**4.2 Real proof of transaction based on deposit certificate**  
The proof of the authenticity of the transaction needs to be recorded in the credit information of the virtual world. The consistency of the virtual information with the real information must be ensured. This is the basis for the development of financial services and risk control. Supply chain finance needs to ensure that participants, transaction results, documents, etc. are based on real asset transactions. Proof of transaction authenticity, using manual means to verify, there are huge deficiencies such as high cost and low efficiency. In the fast operation of large enterprise supply chains, it is difficult to implement manual verification. One of core problems in solving supply chain finance,the authenticity of transactions, requires the cross-validation of information from the trading network in the Middle East and Taiwan to verify the authenticity of the transaction.  

The authenticity of accounts receivable is related to the main body, contract, transaction and other elements. The logical relationship interpretation of its authenticity includes three points: one is the authenticity of the subject, the two sides of the transaction are real and legal subjects; the second is the contract Authenticity, that is, the true and legal basis of the basic contract, if the signature or official seal is forged, it is a false contract; the third is the authenticity of the transaction, and the actual asset transaction occurs. If the contract is true, but no real transaction occurs, the purpose is to obtain bank funds, which is a false transaction.  

But real contracts can also generate false accounts receivable. For example, if you open a trading document or falsely report the transaction amount to get more deposits, it is a false receivable. Therefore, it is reasonable to use accounts receivable as the smallest unit of credit management. When conducting business offline, you need to confirm the identity of the subject and verify the transaction. However, the authenticity of the signature, the authenticity of the documents, etc., are limited by the technical conditions and are the links that generate risks.  

Through the combination of blockchain, Internet of Things, Internet and supply chain scenarios, based on various types of information dynamically obtained in real-time in the transaction network, multi-dimensionally verify data and improve the reliability of the main data, such as: procurement data and logistics data matching, inventory data and sales data verification, core enterprise data and reliability of downstream chain data to reduce process friction caused by information asymmetry.  

**4.3 Credit dismantling based on shared ledger**  
The goal of supply chain finance is to provide comprehensive coverage of SME financing, but the financing needs of a large number of secondary/third-level suppliers/distributors are still difficult to meet.  

In general, the upstream and downstream of a core enterprise gathers to integrate hundreds of small and medium-sized suppliers and distributors. Blockchain technology can dismantle the credits of core companies and pass them to the suppliers and distributors throughout the chain through shared accounts. The core enterprise can register the credit and debt relationship between it and the supplier in the blockchain platform, and pass the relevant accounting vouchers step by step. The original debtor of the bookkeeping voucher is the core enterprise, so in the financing scenario of the bank or factoring company, the process that needs to review the trade background is clear at the platform.  

**4.4 Contract execution based on smart contracts**  
Smart contracts provide automated tools for supply chain finance's business execution, relying on efficient, accurate, and automated execution of contracts. Relieve the difficulty of contract execution in reality. Taking property financing as an example, the completion of delivery can not only send payment instructions to the bank through smart contracts, but also automatically complete fund payment, liquidation and financial reconciliation, improve business operation efficiency, and reduce potential risks and losses caused by human operation to a certain extent. 
At present, the intelligent contract development platforms mainly include: Blockchain Smart Contract System (IBM) Corda Smart Contract Platform (R3 Alliance), Superbook Hyperledger (Linux), Ethereum Smart Contract Platform.

**5. Difficulty during application of blockchain on supply chain finance**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Difficulty in technology aspect**
  * **Privacy problem**
It is worthy to pay attention to privacy problems on the chain. Transaction and credit information consists of sensitive business information, therefore, credit platform puts forward higher demands on data privacy, data saving technology must have strong anti-interception, anti-crack capability. Besides, public block chain finance, every participant will get complete data backup, transaction data is public and transparent. In most scenarios, business institutions are reluctant to share competitors account and transaction information, pivotal assets and business secret.
  * **Data storage capability** 
Because data on block-chain will only be additionally supplemented, instead of being removed, data will increase not decease. With time passed away, demand for size of data storage will continuously increase, especially on processing enterprise data.  

* **Difficulty in promotion aspect**
  * Although it is innovative for block-chain to be applicated in supply-chain financing, it is obstructive to actually apply it in practice. This is because the addition of the block-chain system requires transformation of original business system. At initial stage, it may cost more. The customer needs a section for the new technology application. During the adaptation period, the market size is limited in the short term, and the market potential needs further exploration.  
The block-chain is promising in solving the financing difficulties of small and micro enterprises, but it also faces many problems and challenges. It not only needs technical, legal, and regulatory support, but also needs to include the government, supply chain participants and technology. Stakeholders, such as providers, participate in and promote the construction of the platform, the establishment of block-chain standards, the formulation of relevant laws and policies, and the sharing of information, so that the application of block-chain in supply chain finance is both risk-controllable. It has reached the goal of supporting the real economy and serving small and medium-sized enterprises, and has achieved good social and economic benefits.

**6. Policy recommendations during application**  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The safe channel provides relatively low-cost, efficient and fast financial services for qualified small and medium-sized enterprises. Promote system interconnection and data sharing between the government, banks and core enterprises, strengthen supply chain financial supervision, combat illegal trade such as financing trade, malicious repeated pledge, malicious transfer of goods, establish a disciplinary mechanism for untrustworthy enterprises, and promote supply chain The financial market operates in a regulated manner to ensure that it flows to the real economy.  

**6.3 Actively cultivate open source ecology and enhance industrial influence**  

Give full play to the “race-taking advantage” of industry alliances in group standards and industry standards, and implement problems such as language inconsistency in blockchains and inconsistent smart contract standards, and try to test alliance standards first, guide industrial cluster optimization and upgrade, and improve enterprise competitiveness. Actively cultivate the blockchain open source ecology with Chinese characteristics, build a blockchain open source community, bring together domestic elites and global wisdom, improve China's code contribution in blockchain open source projects, and enhance China's voice in the blockchain field. Influence. Establish a public service platform for R&D and industrialization of blockchain technology, improve the energy level and level of product R&D and industrialization, build a good pattern of “double innovation”, and encourage the deep integration of blockchain and “Internet+” to create a new economic growth pole. Actively guide enterprises to carry out patent layout, prevent patent "traps", protect intellectual property rights, safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises, enhance the international competitiveness of enterprises, and accelerate the realization of "going out" of enterprises.  

**6.4 Improve the regulatory compliance mechanism and promote the development of industry**  

Follow the law of technological development and assign a systematic layout from the policy level. In-depth study of the impact of block-chain on personal information protection, data cross-border flow, etc., explore the regulatory issues of block-chain in the underlying core technology, middle-level application logic and upper-level information monitoring. Actively promote the information disclosure of participating entities in the block-chain system, build a compliance review and audit mechanism for smart contracts, and promote industry self-discipline. Simultaneously carry out research on relevant policies and laws and regulations on block-chain, explore the development of supervision mechanisms and certification systems for block-chain technology and applications, and create a good environment for the healthy development of the industry. Accelerate the improvement of relevant legal planning for blockchains, and incorporate blockchain technology into appropriate regulatory frameworks through legislation, strengthen market supervision in industries such as finance, and prevent systemic risks. As far as possible, strike a balance between maintaining the interests of system participants and maintaining a broader range of social interests, and avoiding a solidified structure that hinders technological innovation.
