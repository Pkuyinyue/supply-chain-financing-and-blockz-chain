##The current state of supply-chain financing
  ----------------------------------------------
###The main form of supply-chain financing
Supply-chain financing comprises trade-financing, which includes three traditional forms of supply-chain financing: accounts receivable financing, inventory financing, prepayment financing, and emerging supply-chain financing forms – strategies relationship financing.

**ARIF（accounts receivable and inventory financing）**is one kind of commercial loans based on asset-control. ARIF can accelerate the cycling speed of capital occupation from inventory, lowering the cost of capital occupation. 
**Prepayment financing **  refers to credit guarantee provided by the third-party logistics enterprise on the premise of the upstream enterprise's commitment to repurchase, and the SME apply for the pledge loan by the financial institutions alleviate the prepayment pressure. Meanwhile, financial institutions control the financing of their delivery rights.
**Strategic relationship financing** requires high levels of trust from both supply and demand side of funds. This feature differentiates original enterprise financing.

##The basis for the development of supply-chain financing
The scale of underlying liquid assets is enough, but supply capacity limits industry size.
The main forms of supply chain financing products are based on accounts receivable and (future) inventories. In China, the accounts receivable and inventory scale of industrial enterprises have already had a certain volume, which laid the foundation for the corresponding supply chain financing. However, the scale of supply chain financing is far less than the basic accounts receivable and inventory financing scale.

However, the banker survey showed that the SME loan demand index continued to be greater than 50%, indicating that the demand for corporate financing continued to exist, while the bank loan approval index continued to be below 50%, indicating that bank loan approval conditions are constantly tightening. Overall, the factors affecting the scale of the supply-chain financing originates from supply side.

**##Pain point in supply-chain financing**
**Difficult credit transfers and narrow service scope**
Since it is difficult for core enterprises to transfer credit to upstream and downstream enterprises, service targets are limited to large enterprises and first-tier suppliers. Otherwise, second-tier suppliers (mostly SME), which really need funds still face problems such as obstructs in financing, high financing costs and inflexible loan terms.
**High operating costs and low business efficiency**
Traditional financial institutions such as banks face a single downstream enterprise, and the cost of solving information symmetry and mastering corporate credit is high:
The real trade background check, the past link is completed manually by manually checking various invoice contracts. Due to the manual operation, there are disadvantages of high error rate and high fraud risk while being inefficient.

1. Transaction confirmation based on Encrypted data
Application of block chain put fororwards higher demands on the information of supply-chain. Although core enterprises and tier one suppliers and distributors in many industries have a good level of information, but the degree of information of SMEs at other levels in the chain is difficult to meet the bank's data standards. At the same time, if different entities on the chain use different types of information management systems, information transmission lacks consistency and continuity, and it is easy to form information isolated islands. It is difficult to obtain effective data for risk judgment and management, to verify the authenticity of transactions. It can be seen that one of the premise of block-chain application is the information of the whole chain.
The block-chain has begun to show important application value in the field of asset management, realizing the real-time nature of the confirmation, authorization and transaction supervision of various assets. Intangible assets that are difficult to regulate and protect under the network environment, block-chain is a new method of intellectual property protection in virtual environments based on the characteristics of time stamp technology and difficulty in tampering. For tangible assets, such as deposit certificates, accounts receivable and digital smart assets, real-world asset transactions can be realized in a virtual environment, such as asset authorization and usage control, product traceability and other applications.
1. Real proof of transaction based on deposit certificate
The proof of the authenticity of the transaction needs to be recorded in the credit information of the virtual world. The consistency of the virtual information with the real information must be ensured. This is the basis for the development of financial services and risk control. Supply chain finance needs to ensure that participants, transaction results, documents, etc. are based on real asset transactions. Proof of transaction authenticity, using manual means to verify, there are huge deficiencies such as high cost and low efficiency. In the fast operation of large enterprise supply chains, manual verification is difficult to implement. One of the core problems in solving supply chain finance, namely, the authenticity of transactions, requires the cross-validation of information from the trading network in the Middle East and Taiwan to verify the authenticity of the transaction and become a supply chain finance. One of the current key technologies.
The authenticity of accounts receivable is related to the main body, contract, transaction and other elements. The logical relationship interpretation of its authenticity includes three points: one is the authenticity of the subject, the two sides of the transaction are real and legal subjects; the second is the contract Authenticity, that is, the true and legal basis of the basic contract, if the signature or official seal is forged, it is a false contract; the third is the authenticity of the transaction, and the actual asset transaction occurs. If the contract is true, but no real transaction occurs, the purpose is to obtain bank funds, which is a false transaction.
But real contracts can also generate false accounts receivable. For example, if you open a trading document or falsely report the transaction amount to get more deposits, it is a false receivable. Therefore, it is reasonable to use accounts receivable as the smallest unit of credit management. When conducting business offline, you need to confirm the identity of the subject and verify the transaction. However, the authenticity of the signature, the authenticity of the documents, etc., are limited by the technical conditions and are the links that generate risks.
Through the combination of blockchain, Internet of Things, Internet and supply chain scenarios, based on various types of information dynamically obtained in real-time in the transaction network, multi-dimensionally verify data and improve the reliability of the main data, such as: procurement data and logistics data matching, Inventory data and sales data verification, core enterprise data and reliability of downstream chain data to reduce process friction caused by information asymmetry.
1.Credit dismantling based on shared ledger
Smart contracts provide automated tools for supply chain financial business execution, relying on efficient, accurate, and automated execution of contracts. Relieve the difficulty of contract execution in reality. Taking property financing as an example, the completion of delivery can not only send payment instructions to the bank through smart contracts, but also automatically complete fund payment, liquidation and financial reconciliation, improve business operation efficiency, and reduce potential risks and losses caused by human operation to a certain extent. 
At present, the intelligent contract development platforms mainly include: Blockchain Smart Contract System (IBM) Corda Smart Contract Platform (R3 Alliance), Superbook Hyperledger (Linux), Ethereum Smart Contract Platform.

**##Difficulty during application of blockchain on supplychain financing **

1.**Difficulty in technology aspect
  1. **Privacy problem**It is worthy to pay attention to privacy problem on the chain. Ttransaction and credit information consists of sensitive business information, therefore, credit platform put forward higher demands on data privacy, data saving technology must have strong anti-interception, anti-crack capability. Besides, public chain of block-chain, every participant will get complete data backup, transaction data is public and transparent. In most scenarios, business institutions are reluctant to share competitors account and transaction information, pivotal assets and business secret.
  1. **Data storage capability** Because data on block-chain will only be additionally supplemented, instead of being removed, data will increase not decease. With time passed away, demand for size of data storage will continuously increase, especially on processing enterprise data.
1. **Difficulty in promotion aspect
  1. ** Although it is innovative for block-chain to be applicated in supply-chain financing, it is obstructive to
